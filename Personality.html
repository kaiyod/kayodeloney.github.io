				<td align="left"><p><font face="Times New Romans">The person I look up to as an icon is a fictional character from a Tv Show called <q>How to Get Away With Murder</q> her name is Annalise Keating who was played by the phenomenal actress Viola Davis.
				 Her struggle with alcohol is a recurring theme throughout the series and contributes to her multifaceted and layered personality. Annalise is a brilliant attorney but beneath all of that she was going through personal trauma
				 like any human being, lost of her son in a car crash, death of her husband, survive being taunted by the <q><em>N</em></q> word and lost friends and loved ones because of her sexuality. Throughout the show, Annalise's 
				 character undergoes significant development, revealing her vulnerabilities, strengths, and the moral gray areas she navigates as she tries to protect her students and herself. She seeks help and took care of her self, which 
				 shows that no matter how established you are or how big you think you are everyone needs help. Watching her and how she navigates her life to ensure that she is happy, loved, free and clean it brings tears to my eyes because
				 I admire her hardwork and it has helped me along the way in my life to ensure that I know what I'm worth and what I deserve.</p>
